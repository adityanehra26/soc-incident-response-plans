## About This Repository

I am a SOC Analyst with hands-on experience in alert triage, phishing investigations, and incident response.  
This repository contains **structured, analyst-friendly Incident Response Plans (IRPs)** designed to reflect how incidents are handled in real SOC environments.

The goal of this project is to document **clear, reusable, and evidence-driven response plans** that can be adapted to different organizations and security stacks.

## Repository Structure

Each incident type is organized into its own directory and contains:

- A dedicated Incident Response Plan
- A folder-level README describing the incident scenario
- Supporting diagrams or references where applicable

In addition, a separate **Templates** directory is included to provide reusable IRP templates that can be customized for new incident types.
